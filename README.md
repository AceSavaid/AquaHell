# AquaHell-GameJam
 A game made in a week for a local game jam with the theme of Hell.  
 You play as an orb of water that has gotten stuck in hell.  With fireballs wanting to dry out the orb, they must run around the area to collect water while using their health to keep the enemies at bay.  After each death, they can purchase upgrades in the shop to make this purgatory easier as they try to survive for as long as possible and get the best score. 

 ## Systems Created
 - Base player with mobility and projectile shooting abilities
 - Enemies that are easily changeable with 3 different typings
 - Various upgrades for the player to obtain to make subsequent rounds easy
 - A shop system for the player to purchase upgrades with the points collected from rounds
 - A slowly ramping random enemy spawning system paired with an increase in the spawn of resources for the player to obtain
 - A save system to track the stats, upgrades, currency, best time and high score of the player even after shutdown to have a level of permanence and better quality of life for the game.

## Other things created
- All art assets used in the game, including sprites, backgrounds and UI elements. 
- All sound effects used in-game
